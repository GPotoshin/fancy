# FANCY

## What is it?
It's a subdialect for great c, that adds functional logic to original language.
The basic syntax should be the same as vanilla c, but with some crazy functional
combinations.

## How it works?
It retranslates fancy code to c code, so realation between c and fance is the 
same as between js and ts.

## What I can do to help this fancy project?
You can propose your genius ideas, how to make it better, while it is still in
pre-alpha.
